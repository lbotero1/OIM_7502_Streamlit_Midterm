# OIM_7502_Streamlit_Midterm
Streamlit Housing Dataset Exploration
This project explores the housing dataset using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. In this project, we provide examples of basic data visualization and input forms for data exploration.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib

Make sure to import streamlit in your code, and other libraries that will help you plot the data
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Usage
To run the Streamlit app, use the following command: streamlit run app.py
This will start a local web server and open the Streamlit app in your default web browser.

Contents
app.py: Main Python script containing the Streamlit app.
Housing.csv: Sample dataset used in the project.
Overview
The Streamlit app consists of two main sections:

Data Visualization: Displays an overview of the housing dataset and a histogram of housing prices.

Data Exploration: Provides an input form for filtering the dataset based on the number of bedrooms and area.
